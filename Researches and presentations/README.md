## Positive and negative effect of hype for Unicorn companies and their valuation
<p>- Unicorn companies are technological companies that have reached valuation of $1b from Venture Capital funds before entering stock market and receiving market valuation <p>
<p>- Unicorn companies are created through strategy of blitz-scaling, which focuses on growth over efficency<p>
<p>- Quantity of such companies accelerated during last decade because of VC funds eager to catch own unicorn in portfolio as well as in result of rapid small investments among large number of tech startups<p>

<p>- Money losing unicorn companies raise more funding during IPO today than profitable companies from Dotcom era used to<p>

<p>- Underpricing is a situation when a company undervalues own stocks for IPO while stock prices skyrocket on the first traiding day, it's good for investors but it is bad for Unicorns since they lose money they could have received from listing. There are factors that increase or decrease underpricing for Unicorn companies, which I uncovered using Multiple Linear Regression: <p>

<p>- I looked at industires and found out that software companies are more vulnerable to underpricing during IPO<p>

<p>- Using event study method, we can measure hype after IPO by looking at abnormal returns. This method uses mathematical appproach to forecasting and comparing forecast to actual stocks returns. I used CAAR (Cumulative Average Abnormal Returns) for grouped Unicorns depending on amount of news articles published before IPO.<p>

<p>- As we can see, on average hype reaches peak on the 3rd month. I compared distribution of CAR (cumulative abnormal returns) between groups during the peak<p>

<p>- Using Kruskalâ€“Wallis statistical test, I have proofed that companies with low hype had lowest CAR<p>

  
<p>- In result as we can see, hype can be both good and bad for unicorn companies. As they lose money because of underpricing, their stocks performance is also guarded by the hype. <p>
