## Did you know?
<p>- Unicorn companies are technological companies that reached valuation of $1b before entering stock market and receiving market valuation <p>
<p>- Unicorn companies are created through strategy of blitz-scaling, which focuses on growth over efficency<p>
<p>- Quantity of such companies accelerated during last decade because of VC funds eager to catch own unicorn in portfolio as well as in result of rapid small investments among large number of tech startups<p>

<p>- Underpricing is a situation when a company undervalues own stocks for IPO while stock prices skyrocket on the first traiding day, it's good for investors but it is bad for companies since they lose money they could have received from listing. However, underpicing is still better than overpricing. <p>
<p>- Greater estimated valuation of the company with demonstration of profitability results in less underpricing. Greater valuation results in more investors researching the company and more risks are being unveiled. <p>
<p>- Large number of funding rounds and demonstration of positive operative cash flow (but no profit) increases underpricing as it is a signal for investors that there is a working monetization model and there is an opportunity for growth<p>
<p>- Software companies are more vulnerable to underpricing during IPO<p>
<p>- Cascade of available information improves stock performance after IPO as it helps for unprofitable companies to keep the hype among investors and prevent stocks from plummeting<p>

<p>- On average hype reaches peak on the third month after IPO, since most of the early investors have their shares locked for a period of 6 months after IPO. Investors tend to sell their stocks before early investors will start selling theirs<p>

  
## Other project I have yet to upload (NDA):

<p>- Ethanol is used in gasoline. There are still issues finding effective technology in production of ethanol from wastes.<p>
