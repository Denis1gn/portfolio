## Did you know?
<p>- Unicorn companies are technological companies that reached valuation of $1b before entering stock market and receiving market valuation <p>
<p>- Unicorn companies are created through strategy of blitz-scaling, which focuses on growth over efficency<p>
<p>- Quantity of such companies accelerated during 2012-2019 because of VC funds eager to catch own unicorn in portfolio as well as in result of rapid small investments among large number of tech startups<p>
<p>- There were more profitable companies going for IPO during Dotcom era than profitable Unicorn companies today<p>
<p>- Underpricing is a situation when a company undervalues own stocks for IPO while stock prices skyrocket on the first traiding day, it's good for investors but it is bad for companies since they lose money they could have gathered from listing<p>
<p>- Greater valuation of the company pre-IPO with demonstration of profitability brings less underpricing, because more investors research the company and risks are on the table. Less risks bring less rewards. <p>
<p>- Larger the number of investment rounds and demonstration of positive operative cash flow (but no profit) increases underpricing as it is a signal for investors that there is a working model of tech monetization and there is an opportunity for growth<p>
<p>- Software companies are more vulnerable to underpricing during IPO<p>
<p>- Cascade of available information improves stock performance after IPO, marketing is important as it helps for unprofitable companies to keep the hype among investors and prevent stocks from plummeting<p>
<p>- On average hype reaches peak on the third month after IPO, since most of early investors have their shares locked for 6 months after IPO, closer to that  <p>
<p>- Did you know Snoop Dogg has own Venture Capital fund? His fund invests in technologies that are connected to cannabis market. From researches and lab equipment to delivery systems.<p>
<p>- Interesting to know, that different strays of cannabis have different terpents since plant grows around the globe and managed to borrow qualities of other plants. You can find cannabis with peach terpents or coniferous terpenes. Different terpens are also associated with different medical effect.<p>
<p>- Canada was one of the first countries who allowed usage of cannabis enriched oil in food industry, so you can try eating chicken with cherry terpenes from olive oil which is mixed with cannabis<p>
  
## Other project I have worked on:
<p>- Did you know that 40% of all corn produced in USA is used for production of ethanol ?<p>
<p>- Ethanol is used in gasoline, imagine how much food we waste every year? There are still issues finding effective technology in production of ethanol from wastes.<p>
