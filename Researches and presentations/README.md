## Positive and negative effect of hype for Unicorn companies
<p>- Unicorn companies are technological companies that have reached valuation of $1b before entering stock market and receiving market valuation <p>
<p>- Unicorn companies are created through strategy of blitz-scaling, which focuses on growth over efficency<p>
<p>- Quantity of such companies accelerated during last decade because of VC funds eager to catch own unicorn in portfolio as well as in result of rapid small investments among large number of tech startups<p>

<p>- Underpricing is a situation when a company undervalues own stocks for IPO while stock prices skyrocket on the first traiding day, it's good for investors but it is bad for Unicorns since they lose money they could have received from listing. There are factors that increase or decrease underpricing for Unicorn companies: <p>

<p>- Using event study method, we can measure hype after IPO by looking at abnormal returns. This method uses mathematical appproach to forecasting and comparing forecast to actual stocks returns. I used CAAR (Cumulative Average Abnormal Returns) for grouped Unicorns depending on amount of news articles published before IPO.<p>

<p>- As we can see, on average hype reaches peak on the 3rd month. <p>
  
  
<p>- CAR (Cumulative abnormal returns) for individual observations was used to check distributions of abnormal returns between groups during the peak of hype<p>

<p>- In result as we can see, hype can be both good and bad for unicorn companies. As they lose money because of underpricing, their stocks performance is also guarded by the hype.
