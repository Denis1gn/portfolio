## Influence of hype on Unicorn companies 
![alt text](https://github.com/Denis1gn/portfolio/blob/main/Researches%20and%20presentations/unicorns%20visuals/1B.png)
<p>- Unicorn companies are technological companies that had reached valuation of $1b from Venture Capital funds before entering stock market and received market valuation <p>
<p>- Unicorn companies are created through strategy of blitz-scaling, which focuses on growth over efficency<p>
<p>- Quantity of such companies accelerated during last decade because of VC funds eager to catch own unicorn in portfolio as well as in result of rapid small investments among large number of tech startups<p>

<p>- Money losing unicorn companies raise more funding during IPO today than profitable companies from Dotcom era used to<p>

<p> For my research on Unicorns I have investigated 75 unicorn companies who have listed on NASDAQ and NYSE

## Hype: good and bad

<p>- Hype affects valuation and can be measured on the first trading day by looking at underpricing and in the first months after IPO by looking at stock performance <p>
  
<p>- Underpricing is a situation when a company undervalues own stocks before IPO while stock prices skyrocket on the first traiding day. It is good for investors but it is bad for Unicorns since they lose money they could have received if proposed higher initial price. Underpricing can be measured with MAIR - Market Adjusted Initial Return. There are factors that increase or decrease underpricing for Unicorn companies, which I uncovered using Multiple Linear Regression: <p>

<p>- Using Mann-Whitney test I also found out that software companies are more vulnerable to underpricing<p>

<p>- Using event study method, we can measure hype after IPO by looking at abnormal returns. This method uses mathematical appproach to forecasting stock prices, then forecasting results are compared to actual stocks returns. I used CAAR (Cumulative Average Abnormal Returns) for grouped Unicorns depending on amount of news articles covered them before IPO<p>

<p>- As we can see, on average hype reaches peak on the 3rd month. It is worth mentioning that too much hype also decreases abnormal returns as hype can be both negative and positive. I have compared distribution of CAR (Cumulative abnormal returns) between groups during the peak<p>

<p>- Using Kruskalâ€“Wallis statistical test, I have proofed that companies with low hype had different CAR compared to hyped companies<p>
  
<p>- In result as we can see, hype can be both good and bad for unicorn companies. As they lose money because of underpricing, their stocks performance is also guarded by the hype. <p>
